# Iris Dataset Neural Network Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a neural network for the classification of the Iris dataset using Google Colab notebooks. The dataset consists of samples from three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The neural network is designed to classify these flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Usage

The code is divided into three sections:

1. **First Iteration (Binary Classification):**
   In the first part of the code, the neural network is set up for binary classification. It classifies the iris dataset into two classes. This section is labeled as the initial implementation.

2. **Second Iteration (Multiclass Classification):**
   In the second part of the code, the neural network is updated to classify the iris dataset into all three classes (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The architecture and training process are adjusted accordingly for multiclass classification.

3. **Third Iteration (Enhanced Model):**
   The third iteration builds upon the second iteration, incorporating enhancements and optimizations.

## Data

The Iris dataset is included in the project. This dataset is used for training and evaluating the neural network. The dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the corresponding class labels.

## Results

The results, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and any relevant metrics, are displayed within the notebook during the execution of each iteration.

## How to Use

To run the notebook, simply open the respective `.ipynb` file in Google Colab. The notebook contains all necessary code, and you can execute each cell sequentially. The Iris dataset is loaded directly from the repository, so there is no need to install any additional dependencies.
